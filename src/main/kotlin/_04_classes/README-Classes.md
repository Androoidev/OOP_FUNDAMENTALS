# 📚 Type of Classes: Exploring Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin

### 🧐 What Are Types of Classes and Why Are They Important?

In **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, classes are the blueprint for creating objects. Understanding the different types of classes available in Kotlin is crucial for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications.

## ✨ Key Types of Classes

### 1️⃣ `Data Class`: Simplifying Data Handling
### 2️⃣ Enum Class: Defining Constant Values
### 3️⃣ Sealed Class: Restricting Class Hierarchy
### 4️⃣ Inline Class: Wrapping Values Efficiently
### 5️⃣ Object Class: Singleton Pattern
### 6️⃣ Abstract Class: Blueprint for Other Classes

## 🚀 Best Practices in Class Design
✔️ Use `data class` for simple models that hold data.

✔️ Use `sealed class` when you need restricted class hierarchies.

✔️ Use `inline class` when you need to wrap a value with minimal memory overhead.

✔️ Use `object` for classes that should have a single instance (e.g., Logger, DatabaseManager).

✔️ Use `abstract class` when you need to define a common blueprint for subclasses.

✔️ Use `enum class` for a fixed set of constant values.

## 🚀 Conclusion
In this module, we explored the different types of classes in Kotlin, covering:

✅ data class for simple data holding.

✅ enum class for predefined constant values.

✅ sealed class for restricted class hierarchies.

✅ inline class for efficient value wrapping.

✅ object class for singleton instances.

✅ abstract class for creating blueprints.
