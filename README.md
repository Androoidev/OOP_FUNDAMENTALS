# OOP Practice in Kotlin 📚

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice** repository in **Kotlin**! 🚀 This project is a comprehensive guide to mastering OOP concepts, from the basics to advanced applications in mobile Android development. Each phase includes hands-on exercises and examples to strengthen your understanding.

## Phases of the Project 🌟

### Phase 1: Fundamentals of OOP in Kotlin 🔹

In this phase, we cover the core principles of **OOP** in Kotlin, helping you build a strong foundation.

#### 🔹 Classes and Objects 🏷️
- **Declare classes** and create **instances**.  
- Understand **properties** and **methods**.

#### 🔹 Constructors 🛠️
- Learn about **primary** and **secondary constructors**.  
- Use **`init`** to initialize objects.

#### 🔹 Encapsulation 🔒
- Master **access modifiers** (`private`, `protected`, `public`, `internal`).
- Create **custom getters and setters** for encapsulation.

#### 🔹 Inheritance 🌱
- Define **base** and **derived classes** using `open` and `override`.  
- Use **`super`** to access parent class properties and methods.

#### 🔹 Polymorphism 🔄
- **Method overloading** and **method overriding**.  
- Working with **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

#### 🔹 Composition vs Inheritance 🏗️
- Learn when to use **composition** (has-a) vs **inheritance** (is-a) in design.

#### 🔹 Data Classes and Sealed Classes 🗂️
- Use **`data class`** for data modeling.  
- Implement **`sealed class`** for closed type hierarchies.

### Phase 2: Advanced OOP and Best Practices 🔹

This phase focuses on advanced OOP practices and best coding practices.

#### 🔹 Extension Functions 🛠️
- Add **functions to existing classes** without modifying their codebase.

#### 🔹 Singletons and `object` 🔑
- Learn how to implement **Singletons** using `object`.

#### 🔹 Delegation in Kotlin 🔄
- Use **`by`** to delegate behavior between classes.

#### 🔹 Exception Handling in OOP ⚠️
- Handle errors using **`try-catch`** and create **custom exceptions**.

#### 🔹 SOLID Principles and Best Practices 🌱
- Apply **SOLID principles** for writing maintainable and scalable code.
- Avoid **bad practices** like excessive coupling.

---

### Phase 3: Applying OOP in Android Development 📱

In this phase, we apply the OOP concepts learned to real-world mobile Android development.

#### 🔹 Data Modeling in an App 📊
- Use **`data class`** for representing **data models** in your Android app.

#### 🔹 MVVM and Architecture in Android 🏗️
- Use **ViewModel** to separate **UI logic** from business logic.
- Implement **Repository** pattern for **data access**.

#### 🔹 Using Classes in Android Components 🎨
- Apply **classes** in components like **Activity**, **Fragment**, and **ViewModel** for clean code.

#### 🔹 Dependency Injection with OOP 🔌
- Learn **Dependency Injection** using **Dagger/Hilt** in Android.
